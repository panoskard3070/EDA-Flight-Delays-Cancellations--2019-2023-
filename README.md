# EDA-Flight-Delays-Cancellations--2019-2023-
This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a large-scale flight dataset (2019–2023), containing over **2.9 million flight records** across major U.S. airlines.   Due to its massive size, the dataset was processed **efficiently in chunks** using pandas’ `read_csv(..., chunksize=...)` approach.
